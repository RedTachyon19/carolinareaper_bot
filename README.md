# carolinareaper_bot

This is the code for the carolinareaper bot. Version control is done here on GitHub, and the bot is run on Replit. This is a music discord bot that has a variety of commands such as play, pause, and disconnect/join voice channels. It can be found in my personal discord server, Hot Chili:

## Future Updates
- [ ] integrate slash commands
- [ ] don't get sued by YouTube
- [ ] learn more about OOPS

### Additional Information
I use the free version of replit and as a result programs close after an hour on inactivity. To keep this bot online all the time, I used uptimerobot which sends requests to the bot in 5 minute intervals to keep the bot online. If you use an IDE without this limitation, delete "keep_alive.py" and the function "keep_alive()" in "main.py" can be deleted.
